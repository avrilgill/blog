- 👋 Hi, I’m Avril
- 👀 Technologies: Java, C, Spring Boot, SQL, NoSQl
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Framework


## Things I personally consider while working on a project or learning a new topic:
1. Time is important, use it wisely ⏳
2. Concentrate on a single topic rather than doing it all at once ✔️
3. Consistency is the key 🔑
4. Learn what you like, clear the basics and then work with problem variations 📚
